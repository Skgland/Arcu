//! Arc based Rcu implementation originally implementated in [mthom/scryer-prolog#1980](https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/pull/1980)
//!
//! ```text
//! A r c
//!   R c u
//! A r c u
//! ```
//!
//! The atomics based version performs lock-free[^1] reads.
//! By using Arc we keep the **r**ead-**c**ritical-**s**ection short and free of user defined code and
//! automatically perform cleanup when no reference remains.
//!
//! To coordinate reads and writes [EpochCounter]s from an [EpochCounterPool] are used.
//! Each read used an `EpochCounter` from the `EpochCounterPool` of the `Arcu` incrementing it once before entering the RCS and once more on leaving the RCS.
//! Each write checks against all `EpochCounter`s in the pool, blocking until it is safe to decrement the strong count of the `Arc` that was replaced by the write.
//!
//! [^1]: when using thread local epoch counter with the global epoch counter pool, the initial read may block while adding the threads epoch counter to the pool
